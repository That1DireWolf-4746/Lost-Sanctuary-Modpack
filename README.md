## README

### Main Mods
#### Oceanus
Instead of an infinite world to explore, you are now limited to a roughly circular landmass surrounded by a bottomless ocean. 
#### Hex Casting + AE2
The Media Catcher draws media from its surroundings to power circuits, and additional fueling needs can be met by draining amethyst via a Media Extractor. The pure media is then transformed into a less volatile but more heavily limited form called Arcane Electricity, and is directed through simple constructed minds to store items as energy. A Charger can turn AE back into media to refill artifacts, overload Amethyst Shards, or power tools. Do not overload Charged Amethyst.
